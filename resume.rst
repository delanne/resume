Recommendations
---------------

- **Severin Walker**, M3aawg Board Member, Director of Product and Technical Services (ISP) at Vade

    "Xavier and I worked together on multiple projects. I was very 
    impressed with his ability to envision marketable product features
    and ideas, and either single-handedly or lead a team of developers 
    to delivery the results efficiently. He was also very skilled in 
    assisting the end-users with deployment and troubleshooting of their
    specific instances. His background lends itself to being adaptable
    to many development lifecycle types as well."

- **Olivier Szika**, Software Technical Architect at Vade
    
    "I really appreciate having Xavier as my manager since 8 years.
    He gave me his confidence and allowed me to grow a lot at Vade.
    Even if he has very good knowledge and references, he remains open-minded
    to other proposals. Our technical exchanges are very constructive and
    we have always been able to converge towards the best solution.
    He has greatly improved the viability of many projects at different 
    levels: continuous integration, technical decisions, implementations, 
    testing, packaging, infrastructure, ...
    He is a hard worker who does not hesitate to look at what is happening under the hood.
    I am lucky to work with him."

- **Damien Alexandre**, Solution Architect at Vade

    "Xavier is the good person to bring the latest technologies and 
    software architecture into your company. With his strong expertise and 
    transversal knowledge, I’ve seen complex projects being brought to life
    in a matter of weeks. I also liked very much technical discussion with him, 
    as debating would often lead to better feature and/or performances."

- **Jean-Francois LAHITETTE**, Director of Quality & Application Integration, Bizanga, managed Xavier at bizanga 

    "Xavier has a lot of great qualities. He is hands on and great
    manager at the same time. If Xavier was not working in France
    I will hire him here in the US. He is a hard worker, do not count
    the number of hours he will add to the day to be successful. He
    has a huge experience with Open sources, quality process and able
    to debug and add new piece of code to any programs developed by
    engineers. I miss a lot Xavier, he is a great competitor and easy
    to work with. Xavier is repected a lot because he can understand
    faster than anybody else a new design and share his knowledge
    quickly with the team. He is a great team player."

- **Jay Gopalakrishnan**, Staff Engineer, Goodmail Systems, was with another company when working with Xavier at bizanga

    "Xavier lead the technical efforts of Goodmail-Bizanga integration and did a superb job. He was highly
    responsive, diligent and an absolute pleasure to work with."

- **Marc Villemade**, Customer Solutions Engineer, Bizanga, worked with Xavier at bizanga

    "I was lucky to work with Xavier at Bizanga Labs where I've been able to appreciate his high level of
    commitment to the product, the company and the team. He knows his craft as an engineer, quickly delving
    deep into the product, knowing its most intricate parts by heart. He is also a very talented QA engineer able
    to set up very precious validation processes previously inexistant, adding to the value of the product thru
    a dramatic increase in quality. Finally, he is a good leader knowing how and when to delegate and how
    to manage the resources at hand in the most efficient manner. I would add that I've also enjoyed Xavier's
    cheerful and friendly attitude both on and off work. A real great addition to any development team !"

- **Reginald Lips**, Lead Automation Engineer, Cloudmark, worked directly with Xavier at Cloudmark

    "Xavier has made a tremendous impact at Cloudmark by developing a Test Automation
    Framework for Cloudmark Security Platform. He's been handling the whole development
    process of this framework which is now fully productized. Xavier made it possible
    to test the product from A to Z, with tons of metrics: coverage, performance,
    reporting, network dump and so on.
    Xavier is also a Python Master and has a deep knowledge of tools for development and testing.
    He’s a great team player, always got our backs to debug some tricky tests or add last minute features!"

- **Steven Kisely**, Software Development Engineer in Test at CloudPassage, worked directly with Xavier at Cloudmark

    "I had the pleasure of working with Xavier while at Cloudmark. Xavier built
    and managed the entire automation framework from launching tests all the way
    up to the Continuous Integration with Jenkins. Not only did it work but it
    was able to scale up to running against dozens of systems and multiple
    Operating Systems. Whoever Xavier works for will be lucky to have him."
