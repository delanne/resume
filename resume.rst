Recommendations
---------------

- **Jean-Francois LAHITETTE**, Director of Quality & Application Integration, Bizanga, managed Xavier at bizanga 

    "Xavier has a lot of great qualities. He is hands on and great
    manager at the same time. If Xavier was not working in France
    I will hire him here in the US. He is a hard worker, do not count
    the number of hours he will add to the day to be successful. He
    has a huge experience with Open sources, quality process and able
    to debug and add new piece of code to any programs developed by
    engineers. I miss a lot Xavier, he is a great competitor and easy
    to work with. Xavier is repected a lot because he can understand
    faster than anybody else a new design and share his knowledge
    quickly with the team. He is a great team player."

- **Jay Gopalakrishnan**, Staff Engineer, Goodmail Systems, was with another company when working with Xavier at bizanga

    "Xavier lead the technical efforts of Goodmail-Bizanga integration and did a superb job. He was highly
    responsive, diligent and an absolute pleasure to work with."

- **Marc Villemade**, Customer Solutions Engineer, Bizanga, worked with Xavier at bizanga

    "I was lucky to work with Xavier at Bizanga Labs where I've been able to appreciate his high level of
    commitment to the product, the company and the team. He knows his craft as an engineer, quickly delving
    deep into the product, knowing its most intricate parts by heart. He is also a very talented QA engineer able
    to set up very precious validation processes previously inexistant, adding to the value of the product thru
    a dramatic increase in quality. Finally, he is a good leader knowing how and when to delegate and how
    to manage the resources at hand in the most efficient manner. I would add that I've also enjoyed Xavier's
    cheerful and friendly attitude both on and off work. A real great addition to any development team !
